/**
 **  The objective of this class is to coordinate a waterproof temperature sensor of the model DS18B20.
 ** With this class is possible to create a really simple interface for DS18B20 and can be scalable to
 ** append more sensors with a correct data structure (Without consume to much memory).
 ** The class is also prepared to avoid memory leak.
